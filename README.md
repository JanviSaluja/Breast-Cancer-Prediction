# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Languages used:
- Numpy and Pandas
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Scikit-learn
- LightGBM and XGBoost
  
## About The Project:
- To gain an understanding of Breast Cancer Variance and prediction work in the field.
- The dataset is composed of various important characteristics obtained from breast biopsies and will be used as a training set for models to distinguish between malignant tumors versus benign ones.
- The most promising of these models is Neural Network, with testing accuracy reaching 98.25 %, and a high F1 score (0.96).
- The Support Vector Machine has a testing accuracy of about 95.61 %, and it also hits that middle ground between precision and recall with an F1 score of 0.92 as well.
- Logistic Regression does pretty well too. Its accuracy is 94.74 % and its F1 score is 0.91 %.
- This analysis provides further assistance in the work to harness machine learning for early and accurate breast cancer detection coupled with efficient medical treatment
